    <h1>Ladakh - The Land of High Passes</h1>
    
    <div class="info">
        <p>Ladakh is a region in the northernmost part of <span class="highlight">India</span>, situated in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. It is renowned for its stunning <span class="highlight">mountain landscapes</span>, high-altitude passes, and Buddhist monasteries.</p>
        
        <p>The region is often referred to as the <span class="highlight">Land of High Passes</span> due to its strategic location along ancient trade routes, with passes like <span class="highlight">Khardung La</span> and <span class="highlight">Chang La</span> being some of the highest motorable roads in the world.</p>
        
        <p>Ladakh is a melting pot of cultures, where <span class="highlight">Buddhist</span> monasteries such as <span class="highlight">Thiksey Monastery</span> and <span class="highlight">Diskit Monastery</span> coexist with traditional <span class="highlight">Ladakhi</span> customs and practices.</p>
        
        <p>The region's stark beauty is enhanced by the crystal-clear <span class="highlight">Indus River</span> flowing through its valleys and the barren yet mesmerizing terrain of the <span class="highlight">Ladakh Range</span>.</p>
        
        <p>Visitors to Ladakh can experience unique cultural festivals like the <span class="highlight">Hemis Festival</span> and indulge in activities such as <span class="highlight">trekking</span> in the <span class="highlight">Markha Valley</span> or <span class="highlight">mountaineering</span> expeditions in the <span class="highlight">Stok Kangri</span> region.</p>
